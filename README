FPGA image for the Zedboard supporting HDMI, OLED, buttons and audio, based on ADI's reference design

To build this design, you need XPS version 14.4 from Xilinx. Also, you will need to get the FPGA
reference design from ADI, which contains the VHDL code. There is no VHDL code in this repository!

Unpack the tar file somewhere, and put this repository in the same directory as it will look for
the IP cores in ../cf_lib.

Load the project into XPS and click the "Export" button. This will build the bitfile, and open the
tooling to build the FSBL. To create the FSBL, follow the procedure on the ADI wiki under "Build the boot image"

You can then use the meta-zynq layer to build a nice linux image with sound and video support out-of-the-box,
by pointing to the "system.bit" and "fsbl.elf" files you created from this repo.

Maybe some day I'll add a bitbake recipe that fetches from this repository and calls the Xilinx tools
directly to generate it all without having to click on all sorts of GUIs.
